## Adding custom puzzles
### In the download folder, there is a Puzzles folder with all the puzzle images. Here, you can edit any of the puzzles or even add your own if you follow some rules!
* Images must be bitmap format.
* The naming convention is "<Puzzle Index>-<Puzzle Name>-<G or F>"
* Each puzzle is a pair of images: 'G' image is the generation image (black and white one) and 'F' image is the full color image.
* Puzzles must be square, and the 'G' and 'F' images for the same puzzle must be the same exact dimensions.
